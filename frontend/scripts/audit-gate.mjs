// npm audit with a reasoned allowlist — ADR 0029.
//
// `npm audit` has no per-advisory exception, so the choice it offers is
// a gate that is red forever or one raised past the severity we care
// about. Both end the same way: nobody reads it. This keeps the gate at
// `high` and lists the exceptions individually, the way
// `tests/test_no_dynamic_sql.py` and the cross-tenant baseline do.
//
// Entries are promises. Each needs a reason that survives review, and
// each should go the moment its fix is reachable.

  // No fixed release exists: the advisory covers every published

  // DoS on deeply nested brace patterns, reached by expanding a glob —
  // and nothing here expands a glob from user input: `braces` arrives
  // under `micromatch` → `fast-glob`, which the i18n and router plugins
  // use at build time to find files on disk.
  //
  // Verified on 2026-10-03: `npm run build` ships none of that chain —
  // `braces`, `micromatch`, `fast-glob` and `globby` are all absent from
  // `.output/server/node_modules`. ("braces" does appear inside
  // `.output/server/chunks/_/icons.mjs`: that is the orthodontic icon.)
  'braces': 'no published fix (<=3.0.3 is every version); build-time glob matching, absent from .output',

  // Same shape: the advisory covers every published version (<=1.4.0,
  // the latest). `node-forge` arrives under `listhen`, the dev-server
  // listener that mints a self-signed certificate for `nuxi dev --https`;
  // the weakness is RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification, which this
  // project never asks it to do. Verified the same way: `listhen`,
  // `nitropack` and `node-forge` are absent from `.output/server`.
  'node-forge': 'no published fix (<=1.4.0 is every version); dev-server TLS only, absent from .output',

  // Both arrive under `@nuxt/devtools`, which runs with `nuxi dev` and
  // nowhere else: verified on 2026-10-06 that `npm run build` ships
  // neither — `simple-git` is absent from `.output/server/node_modules`.
  // The advisories are about git executing what its own configuration or
  // `VISUAL` tells it to, so reaching them means running the dev server
  // against a repository or environment an attacker already controls.
  //
  // The fix is `@nuxt/devtools` 4, which comes with nuxt 4.5.2 — the
  // upgrade Node 20 blocks (see the `nuxt` entry below). Pinning
  // `simple-git` forward instead does not work, and that is measured, not
  // assumed: v4 dropped its default export, `@nuxt/devtools` imports
  // `Git from 'simple-git'`, and `nuxt prepare` dies with "does not
  // provide an export named 'default'" — taking dev and build with it.
  'simple-git': 'dev-only, under @nuxt/devtools; absent from .output; v4 drops the default export devtools imports',
  '@simple-git/argv-parser': 'same chain: dev-only under @nuxt/devtools, absent from .output',

  // Nuxt is pinned to exactly `4.4.5` in package.json, and the reason is
  // Node, not Nuxt: `frontend/Dockerfile` builds on `node:20-alpine`, and
  // 4.4.5 is the last release that supports Node 20 (`^20.19.0 ||
  // >=22.12.0`). Every later one — 4.4.6 through 4.5.x — requires
  // `^22.12.0 || ^24.11.0 || >=26.0.0`. The pin is also what stops CI's
  // `npm install` walking the dependency forward on its own, which is how
  // `cssnano` 8 (Node 22+) got in and took the test job down with
  // `trustedFunctions.difference is not a function`.
  //
  // So the fixes for these live behind a Node upgrade. What is left at
  // 4.4.5, and why each one is survivable meanwhile:
  //
  // - Three island advisories (RCE via island props, unauthenticated OOM,
  //   CPU exhaustion before hash validation). `server/middleware/
  //   no-island-endpoint.ts` answers 404 on `/__nuxt_island/**`. This is
  //   not the old "we render no islands" claim, which was wrong: the
  //   route is mounted in every build, and before that middleware the
  //   built server answered 204 to `/__nuxt_island/Foo:1234.json`.
  // - Payload cache discloses another user's SSR data: only for pages
  //   covered by a `routeRules` `cache`/`swr`/`isr` directive. This app's
  //   `routeRules` set response headers and nothing else.
  // - Route rules dropped for mixed-case paths: it bypasses
  //   `appMiddleware` gates, which this app does not put in `routeRules`.
  //   The headers on `/p/**` are what a mixed-case URL would skip —
  //   narrow, and tracked rather than hidden.
  'nuxt': 'pinned to 4.4.5, the last release supporting the node:20 base image; island endpoint closed by server middleware, no cached routeRules'
