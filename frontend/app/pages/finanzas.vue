 * Finanzas — the money side of a patient's care, in one place.

 * They are one entry and three tabs, in the order money actually moves
 * backwards from: what has been collected, what has been quoted, what
 * has been invoiced.
 *
 * The page owns no knowledge of those modules. Each registers its tab in
 * the `finance.tabs` slot, so uninstalling `billing` simply removes its
 * tab — the mount authority stays `core_module.state` (ADR 0018) and no
 * cross-module import is introduced (ADR 0001).

 *
 * It is the page's own tab rather than a module's because the figures on it
 * come from several — collections from `payments`, the till from `cashbox`

 * module fills `finance.summary` with what it knows (see
 * `FinanceSummary.vue`).
 *
 * First and default on purpose: somebody who opens Finanzas is asking how
 * the clinic is doing, and the answer used to live one sidebar entry away
 * in Informes while this page offered five lists.
