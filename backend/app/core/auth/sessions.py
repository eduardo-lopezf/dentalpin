"""Refresh-token sessions: rotation, reuse detection, revocation.

ADR 0029, invariant 3. The rules this file implements, in one place
because they only make sense together:

1. **A refresh token is spent when it is used.** Every exchange stamps
   ``rotated_at`` on the presented row and issues a new one. A refresh
   token therefore has exactly one legitimate use.

2. **Reuse means theft, and we cannot tell whose.** A bearer credential
   presented twice has two holders. Which one is the attacker is not
   knowable from the request, so the whole family is revoked and both
   have to authenticate again. Refusing only the second presentation
   would leave the thief holding a working chain.

3. **Logout ends the family, not the row.** Ending only the presented
   token would leave its already-issued successors alive, which is not
   what anyone means by logging out.

``User.token_version`` is untouched and still works: it stays the
per-user emergency switch that invalidates *access* tokens too, which
this table cannot do — an access token is stateless by design and lives
15 minutes.
