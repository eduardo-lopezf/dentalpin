    Before this table the only revocation was ``User.token_version``: a
    global switch that logs a user out of every device at once and is
    incremented in exactly one place, when an account is deactivated. A
    clinic that loses a laptop could not end *that* session without
    ending every other one.

    One row per refresh token. ``id`` is the token's ``jti``, so the
    token itself carries no state — the row is the state. Rotation
    creates a new row and stamps ``rotated_at`` on the old one, and every
    row from one login shares a ``family_id``.

    That pairing is what makes theft detectable. A refresh token is a
    bearer credential: a stolen one is indistinguishable from the real
    one *until somebody uses it twice*. When a token that has already
    been rotated (or revoked) is presented again, one of the two holders
    is an attacker and there is no way to tell which — so the whole
    family dies and both parties have to log in.

    Deliberately holds no IP and no user agent. Both are personal data
    under GDPR and would need classification and a retention policy
