"""What each clinic consumes, and what happened in it, for an operator.

Everything here answers to the control plane (ADR 0049 rule 4), so it
returns **sizes, counts and identifiers, never content**: how many bytes,
which user id signed in, which table gained a row. No name of a person,
no contact detail, no clinical text.

The tables are found by asking the database which ones carry a
``clinic_id``, not by importing models: core may not import a module
(ADR 0039), and a module that was uninstalled has no table to count.

A database has no per-clinic size — clinics share its tables — so a
clinic's figure is a share: each table's size on disk, split by how many
of its rows belong to each clinic. What no clinic owns (tables without a
``clinic_id``, the catalogue, empty tables' overhead) is the rest.
