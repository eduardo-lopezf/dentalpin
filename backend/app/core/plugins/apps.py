"""The App catalog.

An App is what a clinic chooses; a module is what the code is made of.
One App groups the modules that only make sense together — "Agenda" is
``agenda`` plus ``schedules`` — and carries its own version, which moves
independently of theirs (ADR 0036).

The catalog is ``backend/apps.json``, one file for the whole deployment.
Each App is ``enabled`` or ``disabled`` there, and a disabled App's
modules are not mounted, whatever ``core_module.state`` says about them
(ADR 0038). Nothing else changes: their tables, their data and their
install state stay as they are, so flipping the flag back restores them.
