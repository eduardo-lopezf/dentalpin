"""The record that a subject request happened.

An erasure is irreversible and leaves the data looking as if it had never
been there. Without a row saying who asked for it, when, and why, the
clinic cannot prove it honoured a request — and cannot tell an erasure
apart from a bug that emptied the columns.

The record deliberately holds **no personal data of its own** beyond the
patient id it acted on: the sections and counts describe what was done,
not what the data said. So it survives the erasure it documents.
