"""Which custody modes an account tier is sold under.

``account_tier`` says what the software does for a clinic; ``CustodyMode``
says who runs the deployment and who holds its keys (ADR 0023). They are
independent axes, and a commercial offer is a *cell* of the matrix rather
than a rung on a ladder — see
``docs/features/licensing-and-packaging.md``. Exactly one rule connects
them, and it lives here.

**The entry tiers are sold hosted, and only hosted.** ``basic`` and
``medium`` are always ``managed``. Every other tier may be ``self``,
``managed`` or ``byok``.

The rule is not a database constraint, and that is deliberate. Only one
half of the pair is in the tenant's own database: ADR 0024 rule 2 keeps
``custody_mode`` out of the data plane, precisely so a claim about who
can read a database is not stored where its own subject can rewrite it.
A ``CHECK`` spanning both halves would therefore require moving custody
down, which is the trade this codebase has already refused. So the rule
is enforced in the application, at the two places where both halves are
known at once: when a clinic is created, and at boot.
