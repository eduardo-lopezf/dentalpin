"""Contracts one module offers and another consumes without importing it.

A module that links to another's data — an appointment to its patient —
has two ways to reach it. Importing the other module's models is one,
and it welds the two together: neither can be read, tested or moved
without the other. This is the second: the core names what is needed,
the owner supplies it from :meth:`BaseModule.get_providers`, and the
consumer asks :func:`provider` (ADR 0039).

:func:`provider` only sees modules that are running, so asking it is
also how a consumer learns whether the link is available. ``None`` means
the owning App is off; the consumer carries on without it (ADR 0037).

Keep each contract to what a consumer actually calls. Rows never cross:
the dataclasses here are the whole vocabulary.
