"""Record module — the clinical record as a composition.

Composes what the installed modules hold about a patient into the shape of a
paper *expediente*: a header, and ordered sections of dated, attributed
entries. It **owns no clinical data**, and that is the point of the design
rather than an omission — see `docs/features/expediente-clinico.md`:

    The record is not a new place to keep clinical data; it is a *view* of
    data seven modules already own, and the moment it becomes a copy it
    starts drifting from the source and there are two truths about a
    patient's allergies.

So the module has no models and no migrations, like `reports`. What it will
own, when those phases arrive, is what genuinely is new: the authorisations
that permit a disclosure (phase 2) and the artifacts a disclosure produces.

**Optional and removable by design.** It is installed from *Configuración →
Módulos*; a clinic that never hands a record to anyone does not need it. The
append-only guarantees it relies on do **not** live here — they are corrections
inside `patients_clinical`, `clinical_notes` and `professionals`, where the
data lives. Uninstalling this module must not make a clinical table deletable
again, which is why those corrections could never have been encapsulated here.
