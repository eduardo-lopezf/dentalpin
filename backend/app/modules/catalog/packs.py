"""Specialty packs: a discipline's reference catalogue, switched per clinic.

Each of the seventeen recognised disciplines comes with a reference
catalogue — its treatments, and the plan templates the treatment-plan
module keeps for it. A clinic **enables** the ones it practises, edits
what it gets freely, **disables** the ones it does not want in its
catalogue, and can **restore** one to the reference.

- *Enable* adds what the clinic lacks and brings back what disabling
  switched off. It never touches a treatment the clinic already has: the
  reference is a starting point, the clinic's catalogue is the clinic's.
- *Disable* deactivates the treatments that belong to no other enabled
  discipline. Nothing is deleted — plans, budgets and the chart point at
  them — and a treatment the clinic created itself is left alone.
- *Restore* puts every reference treatment of the discipline back to the
  reference: names, prices, durations, pricing, chart drawing. What the
  clinic changed on them is lost; what the clinic added is kept. The
  caller is told how many are customised, so it can warn first.

Plan templates are the treatment-plan module's. This module only says
what happened (``catalog.specialty_enabled`` / ``_restored``) and that
module reacts (ADR 0042: events write).
