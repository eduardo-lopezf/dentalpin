"""Liquidations module — settling with associate dentists.

An associate on a percentage is paid from one of two numbers, and they are
not the same number: what they **earned** (the work they performed, priced)
and what has been **collected** for it (what the patient actually paid). On
a large case those are months apart, and paying a percentage of the first
means the clinic hands out money it has not received.

Most Mexican clinics pay on the second, so `collected` is the default —
but both are computed and both are shown, because neither can be judged
without the other. Which one a given professional is paid on is an
arrangement the clinic records per person.

Depends on `payments` for the earned ledger and the FIFO coverage walk that
attributes collected money to the work it paid for, on `professionals` for
who is being settled with, and on `cashbox` — which is the one it writes to:
paying a settlement in cash empties the drawer, and the payout and the till
movement are one fact seen twice.
