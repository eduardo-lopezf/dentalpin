"""Liquidations services.

Settling with an associate dentist. Two numbers decide everything and they
are not the same number:

- what the associate **earned** — the work they performed, priced;
- what has been **collected** for that work — what the patient actually paid.

On a 19.000 MXN orthognathic case those two are months apart, and paying a
percentage of the first means the clinic hands out money it has not
received. Most Mexican clinics pay on the second, which is why `collected`
is the default basis — but both are computed and both are shown, because
neither number can be judged without the other.
