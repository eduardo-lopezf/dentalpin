"""Clinical notes module database models.

Polymorphic clinical-notes store. Notes attach to one of three owner types
and carry a ``note_type`` discriminator that the UI uses for filtering and
color-coding.

Owner / type matrix:

| ``note_type``      | ``owner_type`` | ``owner_id`` references          |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| ``administrative`` | ``patient``    | ``patients.id``                  |
| ``diagnosis``      | ``patient``    | ``patients.id`` (optional tooth) |
| ``treatment``      | ``treatment``  | ``treatments.id`` (odontogram)   |
| ``treatment_plan`` | ``plan``       | ``treatment_plans.id``           |
| ``appointment_clinical``       | ``appointment`` | ``appointments.id``      |
| ``appointment_administrative`` | ``appointment`` | ``appointments.id``      |

``owner_id`` has no DB-level FK (polymorphic) — the service layer validates
that the owner exists in the same clinic before insert.

Document attachments live in the ``media`` module: this module registers
its owner_types (``patient``, ``treatment``, ``plan``,
``appointment_treatment``, ``clinical_note``) with
``media.attachment_registry`` at import time and consumes
``media.AttachmentService`` for link/unlink/list operations. The legacy
``clinical_note_attachments`` table was migrated into
``media.media_attachments`` in revision ``cn_0002``.
