"""Budgets that price a treatment plan.

Everything that writes a budget because of a plan lives here, on the
budget's side (ADR 0042). A plan never calls in: it announces that it
was confirmed, reopened or deleted, and the handlers below react in
their own transaction. The two operations a person asks for by name —
"generate the budget", "price what was added" — are budget endpoints
that read the plan through the ``PlanQuotes`` contract.

Whatever is created is announced with ``budget.created_for_plan``;
``treatment_plan`` links and logs it. This module never touches a
plan's row.
