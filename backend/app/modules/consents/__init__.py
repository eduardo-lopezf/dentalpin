"""consents — consent letters: informed consent and consent to data use.

Part of the Clinical record App. The first of the pieces that implement
NOM-004-SSA3-2012 and Ley General de Salud Art. 51 Bis 1 for the dental
record: the letter in which a patient is told about a procedure, its risks
and its alternatives by a named professional, and accepts or declines.

It also holds the consent to the processing of personal data, which shares
the mechanism — a text, a signature, a revocation — and none of the meaning.
