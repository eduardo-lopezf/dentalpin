/**
 * useSlotGridDrag — pointer-driven drag for the week and day grids.
 *
 * Both grids are the same thing with a different column axis (days vs
 * professionals), and both carried a near-identical copy of this logic
 * built on `mousedown` plus document-level `mousemove`. Chrome on Android
 * emits mouse events only as compatibility events *after* the finger
 * lifts, so none of it tracked on a tablet: no create, no move, no
 * resize. This is one Pointer Events implementation for mouse, finger
 * and stylus alike.
 *
 * ## Fine pointer (mouse, trackpad)
 *
 * Unchanged: press and drag starts immediately. Press on an empty cell
 * and drag down to size a new appointment; press and release without
 * moving is a click on the slot.
 *
 * ## Coarse pointer (finger)
 *
 * A finger cannot hover and a press is ambiguous with a scroll, so the
 * grid uses select-then-drag, the pattern mobile calendars settled on:
 *
 * - Tap an appointment  → open it.
 * - Long-press (300 ms) → select it. The block lifts and grows handles.
 * - Drag a selected block → move it. Drag its handle → resize it.
 * - Tap an empty cell    → create there (no drag; see below).
 * - Tap elsewhere        → deselect.
 *
 * Selection is what makes this work at all. `touch-action: none` is the
 * only way to stop the browser scrolling instead of dragging, and
 * applying it to every block would make the grid unscrollable wherever
 * appointments sit. Applied only while a block is *selected*, the grid
 * scrolls normally until the user has said which block they mean.
 *
 * Drag-to-size on an empty cell is deliberately not offered by touch:
 * it would need `touch-action: none` across the whole canvas, which
 * costs scrolling everywhere to save one modal field. A tap creates at
 * the default duration instead.
 *
 * ## How the two paths are organised
 *
 * Each entry point is a thin dispatcher over a pair of functions named
 * for the capability they serve — `pressAppointmentWithMouse` and
 * `pressAppointmentByTouch` — so which code runs where is readable
 * without tracing conditionals.
 *
 * The split stops where the paths converge. `beginAppointmentDrag`,
 * `onPointerMove` and `onPointerUp` are shared, because once a drag is
 * under way a finger and a mouse want the identical thing; duplicating
 * that arithmetic is precisely how one density bug came to live in both
 * grids at once.
 *
 * The names say *capability*, never device. There is no `...OnIpad`
 * here and there should not be: iPad, Android tablet and a touchscreen
 * PC are one case — a coarse pointer — and Safari on iPad reports a
 * macOS user-agent anyway, so a device branch would not even fire. See
 * ADR 0022.
