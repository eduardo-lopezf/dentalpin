"""What the agenda links to, and whether each link is live.

Patients, professionals, planned treatments and working hours belong to
other Apps. The agenda never imports them: it asks the core for whoever
currently supplies each contract (ADR 0039). No supplier means the App
is off, and the agenda books without that link: it accepts no new one,
shows none of those already stored, and deletes nothing — they show
again when the App returns (ADR 0037).
