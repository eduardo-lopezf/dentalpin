"""Cashbox module — the clinic's till: movements, arqueo, and period cuts.

A *corte de caja* is not a report. The reports in `payments` already answer
"how much came in this week, by method, by professional". What a corte adds
is an **act**: someone counts the drawer, declares what was in it, and the
difference between that and what the system expected is frozen. The number
that matters is the one no query can produce.

Phase 1 ships the half that does not exist anywhere yet — the money that
leaves the till without being a patient payment. It is first because it is
useful alone ("where did today's cash go?") and because without it the
count can never match, the difference is non-zero every day, and the whole
feature gets abandoned as broken.

Depends on `payments` because the arqueo reads its cash collections and
refunds. It never writes there, and `payments` knows nothing about this
module.
