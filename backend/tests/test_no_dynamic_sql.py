"""SQL is not built by pasting strings together.

ADR 0029, invariant 4. Injection is closed by construction here — every
query in request-handling code goes through SQLAlchemy with bound
parameters — so this file is not a scanner hunting for a hole. It is a
ratchet: it makes the *next* f-string in a SQL call an explicit decision
instead of a diff nobody looked at twice.

The scan is an AST walk rather than a grep, because the thing that
matters is not that ``text()`` appears but that its argument was
assembled from parts. ``sa.text("... WHERE id = :id")`` is exactly right
and must not be flagged; ``sa.text(f"... {table}")`` must be, even when
``table`` is a literal three lines up.

Entries in the allowlist are promises, in the shape
``"path/to/file.py::function"``. Keyed by function rather than by line
so an unrelated edit above does not invalidate them, and rather than by
file so a *new* interpolation somewhere else in an already-listed file
is still caught — ``treatment_plan/service.py`` is 1500 lines, and
listing the whole file would exempt most of the module's SQL.
