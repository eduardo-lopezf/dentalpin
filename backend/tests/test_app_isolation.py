"""Which Apps an App's code may reach into — one rule for every App.

The module guard (``test_module_isolation.py``) lets a module import what
its manifest declares, and looks past imports inside functions and under
``TYPE_CHECKING``. This one is about Apps and looks at every import line:
``IMPORTS`` names, for each App of ``backend/apps.json``, the other Apps
its modules import, and ``REQUIRES`` the ones their manifests ``depends``
on.

Both tables are exact. An App that reaches further fails; so does an App
that reaches less than its entry says, until the entry is tightened — the
tables only ever shrink. The core Apps are where they should be: Agenda
and Patients import nothing, Treatments only the Patients App (no
treatment without a patient), and anything else they need they ask of a
core contract (ADR 0039) or hear in an event (ADR 0042). The optional
Apps are recorded as they stand, to be decoupled in turn.
