# The operations endpoint

What an operator's control plane reads from a deployment: how much each
clinic consumes, who signed in, where records were created. It is rule 4
of [ADR 0049](../adr/0049-the-control-plane-is-a-separate-service.md), and
rule 5 is its limit: **sizes, counts and identifiers, never content.**

It also holds the one thing the control plane writes: a new clinic with
its holder (rule 6).

Code: `backend/app/core/ops/` (`router.py`, `usage.py`). Tests:
`backend/tests/test_ops_endpoint.py`.

## Who may call it

Not the clinic's users — no staff session opens it. The caller presents a
JWT signed with `CONTROL_PLANE_SECRET` (HS256), with audience
`dienteazul-ops` and an expiry. The control plane signs one per request,
valid for a minute.

| Situation | Answer |
|---|---|
| `CONTROL_PLANE_SECRET` unset (the default) | `404` — the routes do not exist |
| `TENANT_CUSTODY_MODE=self` | `404`, whatever the secret holds: a self-hosted deployment answers to nobody ([ADR 0028](../adr/0028-self-hosting-is-the-premium-tier.md)) |
| No token, wrong secret, wrong audience, expired, or a staff token | `401` |

The routes sit in the `UNAUTHENTICATED` allowlist of
`tests/test_route_authorization_coverage.py` for the same reason the
WhatsApp webhook does: authorized, just not by a role.

## Routes

### `GET /api/v1/ops/usage`

`?refresh=true` measures again now; otherwise a measurement is kept ten
minutes per process (`USAGE_TTL`).

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `database_bytes` | `pg_database_size` of the deployment's database. |
| `shared_database_bytes` | The part no clinic owns: tables without a `clinic_id`, rows with a null one, empty tables' overhead. |
| `storage_bytes`, `storage_files` | The tenant's storage folder, counted as `GET /auth/tenant/storage` counts it. |
| `clinics[]` | One entry per clinic: `id`, `name`, `created_at`, `apps` (chosen at creation; `null` = all), `status`, `deactivated_at`, `deletable_from`, `users`, `last_access_at`, `database_bytes`, `database_rows`, `storage_bytes`, `storage_files`. |

- **A clinic's database figure is a share, not a measurement.** Clinics
  share tables, so PostgreSQL has no per-clinic size. Each table with a
  `clinic_id` contributes its size on disk (`pg_total_relation_size`,
  indexes and TOAST included) split by how many of its rows are each
  clinic's. A clinic with few, very large rows is under-counted.
- **The tables are found in `information_schema`**, not by importing
  models: core may not import a module, and an uninstalled module has no
  table. It costs one `GROUP BY` per table, which is why it is cached.
- **A clinic's files are its folder**, `<clinic_id>/…`, where the media
  module stores uploads. What the storage holds outside every clinic's
  folder is in the total and in no clinic.
- **`status` is read now, not cached with the sizes.** In this order:
  `deactivated` (the operator closed it); `active` — one of its members
  has a session whose latest token is under an hour old, which is how
  long the app keeps an idle session (ADR 0030); `inactive` — no sign-in
  in fifteen days, or ever; `offline` otherwise. The windows are
  `SESSION_WINDOW` and `RECENT_WINDOW` in `usage.py`.
- **`last_access_at` is of the clinic's members.** A session belongs to a
  user, not a clinic: someone who works in two clinics counts in both.
- **`name` is the clinic's name** — the operator's customer. It is the
  one name this endpoint returns.

### `GET /api/v1/ops/clinics/{clinic_id}/log`

`?limit=` up to 500, default 100. Newest first.

| `kind` | From | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `login` | The first row of a refresh-token family (`auth_sessions`) | `user_id`, `role` |
| `logout` | A family revoked with reason `logout` | `user_id`, `role` |
| `session_revoked` | A family revoked with reason `reuse` — a refresh token presented twice (ADR 0029) | `user_id`, `role` |
| `record_created` | The newest rows of every table with `clinic_id` and `created_at` | `area` (the table's name) |

- **No names, no e-mail addresses, no record content.** A user is an id
  and a role; a record is a timestamp and a table. The test asserts a
  patient's surname and the user's e-mail never appear in the response.
- **Activity does not say who.** Few tables record an author, so
  `record_created` has no `user_id`. It also sees creations only: an edit
  or a soft delete leaves no entry.
- **There is no access log beyond sessions.** `auth_sessions` holds no IP
  and no user agent, on purpose (see the model's docstring); a failed
  login leaves no row.

### `POST /api/v1/ops/clinics/{clinic_id}/deactivate` · `…/reactivate`

Deactivating sets `clinics.deactivated_at`; from then on
`get_clinic_context` refuses the clinic to its members (`403`), who keep
any other clinic they belong to. **Nothing is deleted**, and
reactivating clears the column and brings everything back. Both answer
with the clinic's state: `status`, `last_access_at`, `deactivated_at`,
`deletable_from`.

- **`deletable_from` is `deactivated_at` plus ten days** (`DELETION_WAIT`).
  Deactivating an already deactivated clinic keeps the first date: the
  wait is not restarted by a second click.
- **There is no route that deletes a clinic.** The date says from when
  one may be; what deleting means is not decided. A clinic holds clinical
  records the law makes it keep, invoices, and a record that is
  append-only by design (ADR 0032), and this codebase soft-deletes
  patient data on principle.

### `GET /api/v1/ops/specialties`

The disciplines a clinic's treatment catalogue can start with: `key`,
`names` and `required`. They come from the catalog module through the
`ReferenceSpecialties` contract (ADR 0039), so the list is empty when the
deployment does not run the Treatments App. `required` marks the one
every clinic has — general dentistry.

### `GET /api/v1/ops/apps`

The deployment's Apps, **read from `backend/apps.json` on every
request** (`read_app_catalog`, not the copy cached at boot): what there
is to choose from when a clinic is created. An edit to the file shows
here at once.

| Field | What it is |
|---|---|
| `name`, `tier` | As in `apps.json` (`base`, `core`, `optional`). |
| `enabled` | Whether the deployment is *running* it — decided at boot (ADR 0038), so this one is not the file's. An App switched off for the deployment cannot be chosen for a clinic. |
| `pending_enabled` | What the file says now, when it differs from what is running — an App added or switched since boot. `null` when they agree. It takes effect at the next restart. |
| `requires` | Other Apps that own a module it depends on, transitively. |
| `mandatory_for` | The account tiers whose clinics always have it: every tier for the base App and the core ones, and for an optional App the tiers in its `core_for_tiers`. |

`core_for_tiers` is how the catalog says an App is core for some kinds
of clinic only. Professionals carries it for `clinic`, `clinic_pro` and
`hospital`: a clinic has several professionals, one professional's
practice need not list any.

### `POST /api/v1/ops/clinics`

Creates a clinic and its holder, who becomes its administrator — what
`/auth/setup` does for the first clinic of a deployment, for every one
after it. `201` with `clinic_id`, `name`, `holder_user_id` and
`holder_existed`.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `account_tier` | Any `AccountTier` the deployment's custody mode is sold under (`validate_tier_custody`); `422` otherwise. |
| `timezone` | An IANA id; `422` if it does not exist. |
| `tax_id` | RFC — the holder's under an individual tier, the clinic's otherwise. |
| `holder_first_name`, `holder_last_name`, `holder_email` | The holder's account. `409` if the e-mail's account already belongs to a clinic, or is deactivated — see below. |
| `holder_professional_id` | Cédula profesional; stored on `users.professional_id`. |
| `holder_password` | The holder's first password, given by the control plane. Checked against the password rule; only its hash is stored, and the account is created with `must_change_password`. |
| `specialties` | Optional. The disciplines the treatment catalogue starts with, by key: exactly those end up enabled. Must hold every `required` one; `422` for an unknown key. Left out, the clinic gets the ten baseline disciplines, as after `/auth/setup`. |
| `apps` | The Apps the clinic is set up with, by name. `422` if one is not an enabled App of the deployment, if an App that is mandatory for the tier is missing, or if a chosen App lacks one it requires. Stored in catalog order in `clinics.apps`. |
| `clinic_name`, `clinic_legal_name`, `clinic_phone`, `clinic_email` | The clinic's own details. `clinic_name` is required unless the tier is an individual one, where all four are ignored. |

- **Individual tiers are `basic`, `medium` and `advanced`** — one
  professional's practice. The clinic record takes the holder's name and
  the holder's RFC, because every record in the system still hangs from a
  clinic.
- **`clinic.created` is published after the commit**, so modules seed
  their baseline data (the catalog its VAT types, categories and
  specialties) exactly as after `/auth/setup`.
- **A clinic only has the Apps chosen for it.** `clinics.apps` narrows
  what the deployment runs (ADR 0038) for that clinic, in three places:
  the routes of a module whose App is not on the list answer `404` to its
  members (`get_clinic_context`, by the module in `/api/v1/<module>/…`),
  `/modules/-/active` leaves those modules out — so the menu, the route
  guard and the slots follow — and `/auth/me` leaves out their
  permissions. `GET /apps` reports `enabled` for the caller's clinic.
  `NULL` — every clinic that existed before, and the one `/auth/setup`
  makes — means nobody chose, and reads as all of them.
- **A clinic may also be offered Apps** (`clinics.available_apps`): ones
  it does not have and whose administrator can switch on from Settings →
  Apps. `POST /ops/clinics` and `PATCH /ops/clinics/{id}` take
  `available_apps`; `GET /api/v1/apps` marks them `available` for the
  clinic; and `POST /api/v1/apps/{name}/enable` (`admin.clinic.write`)
  moves one into `apps`, together with the Apps it requires when those
  were offered too — `409` when one was not, `403` for an App that was not
  offered. It takes effect at the next request. Nothing switches an App
  off from the clinic's side. An App on neither list is not available.
- **What it does not narrow yet:** event handlers, scheduled jobs and
  what one module does on behalf of another still run for every clinic of
  the deployment. A clinic without Recalls gets no Recalls screen or
  route, but the module still reacts to that clinic's appointments. That
  remainder is commitment 20 of
  [`commitments-register.md`](commitments-register.md).
- **One e-mail, one account, one clinic.** An e-mail whose account
  already belongs to a clinic is refused with `409`, naming the clinic:
  the new account needs another e-mail, or that user removed from their
  clinic first. An account that belongs to no clinic — it was removed —
  becomes the holder as it is: its name, its password and its
  `must_change_password` are not touched (`holder_password` is ignored),
  `professional_id` is filled in only if empty, and the answer carries
  `holder_existed: true`. A deactivated account is refused.
- **The holder has to replace the password at the first sign-in.** While
  `users.must_change_password` is set, `get_clinic_context` answers `403`
  to everything; the account can read `/auth/me` and call
  `POST /api/v1/auth/password` (current and new password; the new one
  must differ), which clears the flag. The app sends such an account to
  `/change-password` and nowhere else.
- **`specialties` travels on `clinic.created`.** The catalog seeds the
  clinic as usual and then disables the baseline disciplines that were
  not chosen and enables the chosen ones beyond the baseline — its own
  pack operations, so plan templates follow.

### A clinic: `GET` · `PATCH` · `DELETE /api/v1/ops/clinics/{clinic_id}`

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET` | The clinic with everything it was created with: `name`, `account_tier`, `timezone`, `tax_id`, `legal_name`, `phone`, `email`, `apps`, `specialties` (the disciplines switched on, read through `ReferenceSpecialties.enabled`) and `holder` — its longest-standing administrator. |
| `PATCH` | Changes all of that except the holder, **under the rules of creation**: the tier must be sold under the deployment's custody mode, `apps` must hold what the tier makes mandatory and what each App requires, `specialties` must hold the one every clinic has. Under an individual tier the record takes the holder's name and the clinic's own details are left alone. The holder is changed on their account (`PATCH /ops/users/{id}`). |
| `DELETE` | Deletes the clinic for good. **`403` when `ENVIRONMENT=production`.** |

- **Specialties change after the commit.** `PATCH` publishes
  `clinic.specialties_set` and the catalog enables and disables its packs
  to match — its own operations, so plan templates follow. The answer
  carries the set that was asked for.
- **Deleting follows the foreign keys** (`app/core/ops/purge.py`): from
  `clinics` down, whatever points at a row goes before the row, so no
  constraint is switched off and nothing is left dangling. The accounts
  that belonged to no other clinic go too — unless something outside the
  clinic still points at one, which is then left without a clinic — and so
  does the clinic's folder of uploaded files. A clinic the operator means
  to remove in production is deactivated instead.

### `PUT /api/v1/ops/clinics/{clinic_id}/apps`

A clinic's Apps on their own: `apps` (the ones it has) and
`available_apps` (the ones it may switch on itself); an App on neither is
not available to it. Nothing else about the clinic is sent or changed.
The rules of creation hold — what its tier makes mandatory stays, an App
comes with what it requires — and the change takes effect at the clinic's
next request. It is how the console gives, offers or takes away one App
at a time.

### Staff accounts: `GET /api/v1/ops/clinics/{clinic_id}/users` · `PATCH /api/v1/ops/users/{user_id}` · `DELETE /api/v1/ops/users/{user_id}`

The accounts of a clinic's staff, for the operator's console. This is the
one place the endpoint returns people's names and e-mail addresses: staff
accounts, never patients (ADR 0049 rule 5, amended).

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET …/clinics/{id}/users` | Each account of the clinic: `id`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `professional_id`, `is_active`, `must_change_password` and its `role` there. Never the password or its hash. |
| `PATCH …/users/{id}` | Corrects `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `professional_id`; a field left out stays. `409` if the e-mail is another account's. The password is not something this route knows about. |
| `DELETE …/users/{id}` | Deletes the account for good, with its memberships and sessions. **`403` when `ENVIRONMENT=production`.** `409` if any record still points at the account — it is not cascaded away. |

- **Deleting is a development convenience.** Test accounts pile up there.
  In production an account is deactivated, never deleted: what it wrote
  has to keep its author.
- **Removing someone from a clinic is not here.** It is what a clinic's
  own administrator does (`DELETE /api/v1/auth/users/{id}`), and it is
  what frees an e-mail for a new clinic.

## Reading it from the control panel

In development the panel calls it for the stack of this repository. Set
the same value as `CONTROL_PLANE_SECRET` in the root `.env` and as
`CONTROL_DEV_PLANE_SECRET` in `control/.env`, then recreate both
containers. See `control/README.md`.
